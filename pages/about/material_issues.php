                <p>The material issues are reviewed annually by the board and management where all relevant internal, industry and macroeconomic factors are evaluated. The needs, expectations and concerns of the stakeholder groups that are most likely to influence the group’s ability to create sustainable value, notably customers, suppliers, regulators, staff, shareholders and providers of financial capital are central to determining the material issues.</p>
                <p>Following the review for the 2019 financial year, the directors confirm that the current material issues remain relevant and are unchanged from the previous year.</p>

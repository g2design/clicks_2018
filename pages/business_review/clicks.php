                <p class="margin-top-20px">Clicks delivered another resilient performance in the increasingly constrained consumer spending environment. The strength of the Clicks brand and its loyal customer base contributed to health and beauty sales increasing by 11.7%, with volume growth of 5.1% in same stores, as Clicks gained market share in all product categories.</p>
                <p>Clicks was again rated as the country’s leading health and beauty retailer and pharmacy chain in the Sunday Times/ Sowetan Shopper Survey for 2018.</p>
                <h4 class="sky-blue">Sales performance</h4>
                <p>Clicks has been synonymous with value retailing since its founding 50 years ago and value is particularly relevant to cash-strapped customers in the current challenging economic climate. Clicks continues to invest to offer great everyday pricing and this is supported by an active promotions strategy, centred around the brand’s well-known 3 for 2 offers. Promotional sales increased by 14.7% and accounted for 35.0% of turnover in Clicks.</p>
                <p>Pharmacy sales grew by 13.2% and comprised 30.8% of turnover. Growth was impacted by the poor winter season for colds and flu which depressed medicine sales as well as the low SEP increase relative to the previous year. Clicks continued to grow ahead of the market and increased its share of the retail pharmacy market from 22.1% to 23.3%.</p>

                </blockquote>
                <p>Front shop health was the fastest-growing category with sales increasing by 14.1%, supported by the robust performances of GNC (up 19.5%), first aid (up 21.5%) and baby (up 19.6%). The baby sub-category is strategically important in attracting new customers and grew market share from 13.7% to 15.1%.</p>
                <p>Beauty and personal care sales grew by 7.6%. Owing to the limited product innovation in these categories, promotional activity was key to driving volume growth. The best-performing sub-categories were ethnic haircare, gifting and The Body Shop range which has been extended into a further 48 Clicks stores.</p>

                <p>General merchandise, which has the most discretionary product offering, grew sales by 13.1%. Growth was driven by buoyant Christmas sales, a pleasing promotional performance from convenience categories such as paperware and beverages, and good growth in the healthy snacking category. Clicks remains the leader in sales of small electrical appliances with a market share of 17.9%.</p>

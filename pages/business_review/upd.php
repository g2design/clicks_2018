                <p class="margin-top-20px">UPD maintained its market-leading positions in both the pharmaceutical wholesale and bulk distribution markets as the business gained market share, secured new distribution clients and reported ongoing excellent control of inventory and costs.</p>
                <p>Turnover increased by 8.4% and UPD maintained its operating margin at 2.7% despite the low increase of 1.26% in the regulated single exit price (SEP) of medicines, compared to 7.5% in the previous year.</p>

                <p>UPD’s total managed turnover, combining fine wholesale turnover with the turnover managed on behalf of bulk distribution clients, increased by 8.9% to R17.9 billion.</p>
                <div class="text-center margin-top-20px margin-bottom-20px">
                    <img src="assets/img/business_review/p51_wholesale_turnover_graph.png" alt="Wholesale turnover" style="width: 400px;">
                </div>
                <p>Wholesale turnover increased by 8.2% with inflation slowing to 2.9% for the year compared to 5.8% in the previous year. UPD’s solid growth resulted in its wholesale market share increasing from 25.6% to 26.0%.</p>
                <p>Sales to Clicks pharmacies increased by 13.1% and Clicks remains UPD’s largest single customer, accounting for 54.5% of wholesale turnover.</p>
                <p>Sales to private hospital groups, including Life Healthcare, Mediclinic and Netcare, showed muted growth of 4.1%.</p>
                <p>UPD services approximately 1 200 independent pharmacies and sales to this channel grew by 1.4% and accounted for 14.9% of turnover. This was driven by pharmacy groups, particularly Link, demonstrating the benefits of brand affiliation and economies of scale in tough market conditions.</p>
                <p>In addition to the ongoing margin pressure from the faster growth in lower-priced generics, UPD also encountered headwinds from the lower incidence of colds and flu in the second half of the year. Sales of generic medication increased by 13.2% and now account for 69% of wholesale turnover volume.</p>
                <p>As UPD has a high fixed cost base management continuously seeks ways to off-set margin pressure by extracting efficiencies across all aspects of the operations, including inventory management, labour productivity and transport optimisation.</p>
                <p>UPD owns its five distribution centres located in Gauteng (Lea Glen), Cape Town, Durban, Bloemfontein and Port Elizabeth. Distribution capacity has been increased by approximately 30% following the expansion of the Cape Town distribution centre, which was completed in February 2018 at a cost of R30 million and the reorganisation of the Lea Glen facility. All the distribution centres are ISO9001:2015 certified. UPD won a gold award at the 2018 logistics achiever awards which recognises excellence in supply chain and logistics.</p>

                <p>Product availability, which is core to offering superior range and service to customers, averaged 95% for the year while on-time deliveries&nbsp;were&nbsp;99%.</p>
                <p>Through its distribution business UPD offers local and international, generic and originator pharma manufacturers an efficient and cost-effective supply chain solution. UPD gained three new distribution contracts and at year-end managed a portfolio of 23 distribution clients.</p>
                <h4 class="sky-blue">Outlook for 2019</h4>
                <p>UPD aims to increase wholesale market share to 26.5% through the growth of the Clicks pharmacy channel, benefiting from the planned opening of 30 to 35 new pharmacies in Clicks, and maintain volumes from the private hospital groups.</p>
                <p>The business aims to pursue new distribution contracts and one new contract commenced in the first quarter of the 2019 financial year.</p>
                <p>Capital expenditure of R77 million has been committed for warehouse equipment and information technology in the year ahead.</p>
                <p>The medium-term target for UPD’s operating margin has been increased from the current 2.2% – 2.7% to a range of 2.5% – 3.0% which management believes is a sustainable margin owing to the growth in the bulk distribution business.</p>
                <p class="margin-bottom-20px">UPD remains committed to its long-term strategic objective of growing market share in both wholesale and bulk distribution to 30%.</p>

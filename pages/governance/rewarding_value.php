                <p>Clicks Group’s remuneration policy is aimed at driving a high-performance culture that creates sustainable value for shareholders.</p>
                <p>The remuneration policy, which is outlined in part 1 of this report, will again be proposed to shareholders for a non-binding vote at the annual general meeting (AGM) in January 2019. The application of the remuneration policy in 2018, which details how the group has rewarded value creation, is covered in part 2 of this report. In accordance with the King IV governance code, this implementation report will be tabled separately to shareholders for a non-binding vote at the AGM.</p>
                <p>Clicks Group values the views and insights of investors, and encourages shareholders to proactively engage with management on remuneration issues to enable informed decisions to be made when voting on the group’s remuneration policy.</p>
                <p class="margin-bottom-5px">In addition to this commitment, and in accordance with King IV, in the event that either the remuneration policy or the implementation report receives 25% or more dissenting votes, management will engage directly with these shareholders to:</p>
                <ul class="margin-top-0">
                    <li>determine the reasons for the dissenting votes; and</li>
                    <li>address legitimate and reasonable objections or concerns by clarifying or amending the remuneration policy, its implementation or processes, or reviewing the remuneration governance, or taking other steps to resolve the concerns.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The steps taken to address legitimate and reasonable concerns will be disclosed in the following years’ integrated report.</p>
                <p>The remuneration philosophy and reward principles remain consistent with last year when the remuneration policy was aligned to King IV to outline the group’s approach to fair, responsible and transparent remuneration practices across the business. At the 2018 AGM, 93.9% of shareholders who voted supported the group’s remuneration policy and 94.6% supported the group’s remuneration implementation report.</p>
                <p class="margin-bottom-40px">This report provides an overview of the remuneration of all group employees as well as disclosing executive director remuneration and the alignment with shareholder value creation. The remuneration paid to executive and non-executive directors for the 2018 financial year is detailed on <a href="">pages 75 and 77</a>.</p>

                <h5 class="margin-bottom-0">Introduction</h5>
                <p class="margin-bottom-5px">The group’s remuneration policy is based on the total rewards model and integrates the five key elements that attract, motivate and retain human capital to achieve the desired business results:</p>
                <ul class="margin-top-0">
                    <li>compensation;</li>
                    <li>benefits;</li>
                    <li>performance and recognition;</li>
                    <li>learning and development; and</li>
                    <li>work-life integration.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The reward principles of fair and responsible remuneration, market competitiveness, and pay-for-performance are entrenched in the policy. The policy is transparent and incorporates a pay framework that clearly differentiates between occupational levels and pay grades that facilitate remuneration benchmarking for each job within a skill pool.</p>
                <p>The remuneration mix includes a combination of monetary and non-monetary rewards for employees in exchange for their time, efforts, talent and performance at an individual, team and company level.</p>
                <p>Monetary rewards include annual guaranteed pay, variable pay such as short and long-term incentives that relate to performance to agreed targets, as well as other benefits.</p>
                <p>Non-monetary rewards are less tangible and range from formal and informal recognition programmes, training and job rotation opportunities and exposure to stimulating work assignments, all of which are designed to motivate, affiliate and retain employees.</p>
                <p>Employees receive a total reward statement annually which provides a personalised comprehensive view of all their rewards.</p>
                <p>Pay levels are benchmarked on national and retail market benchmark data. The 2018 benchmarking process and the resultant pay framework was peer reviewed by independent reward consultants (21st Century) who verified the accuracy of the benchmarking process and outcomes, as well as compliance to King IV. Premiums are paid for scarce and critical skills such as pharmacy, buying and planning, finance and IT skills, based on the relevant market data.</p>
                <p>Annual salary increases are merit based, with increases being directly related to each employee’s annual performance rating. The range of increase percentages per performance rating is applied consistently across the group, including to the executive directors. The annual increase for an employee in the bargaining unit is based on a collective bargaining process (refer to the <a href="">section on remuneration of management&nbsp;and&nbsp;staff</a>).</p>
                <h5 class="margin-bottom-0">Remuneration structure</h5>
                <p>The total rewards framework provides flexibility to meet the differing needs of employees.</p>
                <p class="margin-bottom-5px">Annual guaranteed pay is determined by considering the following factors:</p>
                <ul class="margin-top-0">
                    <li>the size of the job, based on the Hay job evaluation methodology;</li>
                    <li>the nature of the job relative to its defined market position, including any market premiums for scarce and critical skills;</li>
                    <li>individual performance as assessed during the performance review process; and</li>
                    <li>individual position in the pay band range relative to competence and talent positioning.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The remuneration and nominations committee (the committee) reviews the group’s overall pay framework annually against defined market benchmarks per job grade, job size or skill pool.</p>
                <p>The group’s benchmarking and market information is based on independent surveys, including the PricewaterhouseCoopers REMchannel, Deloitte Top Executive and The Korn Ferry surveys. These benchmarking exercises recognise the complexity in the group’s business model and the regulatory environment within which the group operates.</p>
                <p>The group also participates in a biennial benchmarking exercise to maintain a competitive remuneration position in respect of pharmacists and pharmacy managers.</p>
                <p class="margin-bottom-5px">The annual performance review of all employees focuses on both financial and non-financial levers across the following metrics:</p>
                <ul class="margin-top-0">
                    <li>Financial performance</li>
                    <li>Business process improvement metrics, including transformation targets, where this can be influenced by the employee</li>
                    <li>Customer satisfaction</li>
                    <li>Learning and growth</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Executives are also measured against the objectives set by the social and ethics committee in relation to all the elements of the BBBEE scorecard.</p>
                <p>All employees are required to achieve a satisfactory performance rating to qualify for full participation in the shortterm incentive scheme.</p>
                <h4 class="sky-blue">Executive directors' remuneration</h4>
                <p>The group’s remuneration policy has been reviewed by the committee to ensure that executive directors’ remuneration is fair and responsible in the context of overall employee remuneration, particularly given the nature of the retail industry and considering South Africa’s socio-economic landscape.</p>
                <p>The policy prescribes that the levels of pay and incentives awarded to executive directors are set rationally and impartially, and are free from discrimination, self-interest, prejudice or favouritism. Executive pay is linked to value creation and positive outcomes, is subject to independent oversight and approval by the committee, and is considered by the directors to be sustainable and responsible.</p>
                <p>To align with shareholder interests, executive remuneration is linked to the group’s performance, with clearly defined and measurable one-year and three-year deliverables.</p>
                <p>The remuneration of executive directors consists of three components:</p>

                <p>The performance of the chief executive officer is assessed by the committee, while the performance of the other executive directors is evaluated by the chief executive officer and reviewed by the committee.</p>
                <p>The annual pay increase of the executive directors is directly related to individual performance ratings and aligned to the annual increase ranges per performance rating as determined by the committee and applied consistently across the group. The sustainability of the group’s business is critical in determining remuneration and the board is satisfied that the performance targets do not encourage increased risk-taking by the executives.</p>
                <h5 class="margin-bottom-0">Incentive schemes</h5>
                <p>A significant portion of short-term and long-term remuneration is variable and designed to incentivise executive directors.</p>
                <p>Should executive directors not meet the targets set by the committee for the short-term and long-term incentive schemes, then no amounts will be payable under the schemes and executive directors will only receive their guaranteed remuneration. Performance hurdles and caps for both the short-term and long-term incentive schemes apply to the participants, including the executive directors, which are set out below and on <a href="">pages 71 to 73 respectively</a>.</p>
                <h5 class="margin-bottom-0">Short-term incentive scheme</h5>
                <p class="margin-bottom-5px">A bonus of 40% (60% in the case of the chief executive officer) of annual guaranteed pay is paid on the achievement of an ontarget performance with performance hurdles of at least 95% of the targeted group RONA and operating profit.</p>
                <ul class="margin-top-0">
                    <li>Performance exceeding the targeted performance may result in the payment of a higher bonus. This is self-funded and only paid if the group exceeds the targeted operating profit.</li>
                    <li>The scheme provides for a stretch performance incentive to drive extraordinary performance. The stretch performance hurdle is met when the targeted group RONA is achieved and the targeted operating profit has been exceeded by at least 5%.</li>
                    <li>Bonus payments are capped at 120% of annual guaranteed remuneration for the chief executive officer and at 80% for the other executive&nbsp;directors.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The achievement of targets is reviewed by the committee before any incentive payments are made to executive directors.</p>
                <h5 class="margin-bottom-0">Long-term incentive scheme</h5>
                <p>Executive directors participate in the cash-settled long-term incentive scheme which is detailed on <a href="">pages 72 to 74</a>.</p>
                <h4 class="sky-blue">Remuneration of management and staff</h4>
                <p>Senior managers receive an annual guaranteed salary and participate in the short-term incentive bonus scheme. Salaries may include premiums for scarce and critical skills. A limited number of senior managers participate in the long-term incentive scheme, based on strategic contribution to their business unit and their individual performance levels.</p>
                <p>An annual performance-based salary increase is paid to all permanent monthly paid non-bargaining unit employees. The annual increase date is 1 September which is aligned with the group’s financial year and budgeting period.</p>
                <p>Collective salary increases are negotiated with the representative trade union for the Clicks bargaining unit. The negotiation team is headed by the Clicks human resources executive. Trade union membership comprises 13% of the total group employees (2017: 18%). The employees in the bargaining unit also participate in the group’s short-term incentive schemes.</p>
                <p>All store employees’ compensation complies with the sectoral determination and is above the national minimum wage or statutory requirements in all countries in which the group operates and the minimum rates of pay as determined for the retail industry are either met or exceeded.</p>
                <p>Through a partnership with Discovery Health, and as an additional element within the total reward strategy, approximately 9 000 employees with six months continuous service in customer service, clerical and supervisory roles will be enrolled on the Discovery PrimaryCare Comprehensive plan on 1 January 2019. The employee’s membership will be funded by the company. Employees will have the option to include their spouse and child dependants at their own cost through a monthly payroll deduction. The plan provides comprehensive primary and trauma care, including unlimited access to a general practitioner, optical and dental benefits, ambulance and casualty services. The introduction of this health benefit will contribute to reducing the inequality in healthcare services provided to the different segments of society, and will contribute to increased employee affiliation and retention, as well as improving the health and well-being of employees and their family members.</p>
                <p>The healthcare needs of all other permanent employees are catered for through membership of one of the company’s approved medical aid schemes (Horizon Medical Scheme, Discovery Health Medical Scheme and Profmed Medical Aid Scheme).</p>
                <h5 class="margin-bottom-0">Employee share ownership programme</h5>
                <p>The employee share ownership programme (ESOP) was implemented in 2011 to attract and retain scarce and critical skills, accelerate transformation, build employee commitment and enable employees to share in the growth and success of the business.</p>
                <p>Entry to this scheme closed in 2015 and the scheme matures in 2018 and 2019.</p>
                <p>The executive directors and senior employees who participate in the group’s long-term incentive scheme did not participate in the ESOP.</p>
                <p>Through the ESOP scheme 10% of the group’s issued shares (after the issue of “A” shares equating to 29.2 million “A” shares) were placed in a share trust for allocation to all full-time permanent staff. Employees with more than five years’ service, pharmacists and senior employees from designated employment equity groups received a 15% enhancement of their share allocation.</p>
                <p>Shares are held by 7 839 beneficiaries, with black employees receiving 86% and women 65% of the shares. Pharmacists comprise 5% of the ESOP beneficiaries. Participating employees receive a cash dividend annually, equal to 10% of the total dividend paid to ordinary shareholders each year.</p>
                <h5 class="margin-bottom-0">Group retention scheme</h5>
                <p>The group retention scheme is aimed at retaining talented employees by providing them with a long-term financial incentive which is aligned with shareholders’ interests.</p>
                <p>The scheme targets high-potential employees, black staff and employees with scarce and critical skills. There are currently 42 employees participating in the scheme, of whom 31% are black and 33% are women.</p>
                <h4 class="sky-blue">Incentive schemes</h4>
                <p>Short-term and long-term incentives are an integral part of the total rewards framework and aim to align employee performance with the interests of shareholders.</p>

                <p class="margin-bottom-5px">All permanent employees in the group participate in the short-term incentive schemes which reward the achievement of performance targets of the business.</p>
                <ul class="margin-top-0">
                    <li><b><em>RONA-based short-term incentive scheme</em></b>
                        <p class="margin-bottom-5px">Performance for the group’s RONA-based short-term incentive scheme is measured at the group, business unit and team level against agreed targets. Although the scheme rewards team performance, individual performance as measured through the group’s annual performance appraisal process may limit the value of the payment should an employee not meet individual performance targets.</p>
                        <p class="margin-bottom-5px">Performance exceeding the targeted performance may result in the payment of a higher incentive, provided this is funded by an increase in the operating profit. Incentives for management and staff are capped at two times the value of an on-target bonus.</p>

                <h5 class="margin-bottom-0">Long-term incentive scheme</h5>
                <p>Long-term incentive (LTI) schemes are aimed at aligning executive remuneration with shareholder interests by rewarding executives for the creation of shareholder value. The LTI schemes have a three-year term, with performance hurdles. Successive annual allocations ensure that the executives and senior managers who participate in the scheme are incentivised based on the sustained performance of the group measured by the increase in diluted headline earnings per share (HEPS) and the increase in total shareholder return (TSR).</p>

                <p>In line with best governance practice, non-executive directors do not participate in incentive schemes.</p>
                <h4 class="sky-blue">Executive service conditions</h4>
                <p>The chief executive officer is subject to a 12-month notice period and the other executive directors to a six-month period. The retirement age for the current chief executive is 65 while the other executive directors retire at the age of 63. None of the executive directors are appointed on fixed-term contracts.</p>
                <h4 class="sky-blue">Non-executive directors' fees</h4>
                <p>The fee structure for non-executive directors is based on a review of a number of internal, economic and market factors, and is independently benchmarked each year. The group’s policy is to pay non-executive director fees in a range of 80% to 120% of the median of a comparator group of JSE-listed retail companies. The median is based on the number of board and committee meetings held per annum. Non-executive directors receive a base fee for serving on the board or any committee, together with an attendance fee per meeting. The base fee comprises 75% of the total fee. The chairman of the board or any committee receives a higher fee. Directors’ fees are paid for a calendar year.</p>
                <h4 class="sky-blue">Remuneration governance</h4>
                <p>The committee, operating under the authority delegated by the board, is responsible for overseeing the establishment and maintenance of the group’s remuneration policy, policy outcomes and pay practices. The committee assists the board in ensuring the group has a competitive remuneration policy and governance framework which is aligned with the group’s strategic and organisational performance objectives.</p>
                <p>In line with the recommendations of King IV the committee comprises only independent non-executive directors, namely Professor Fatima Abrahams (chair), John Bester, David Nurek and Martin Rosen. The chief executive officer and the group human resources director attend committee meetings by invitation but are recused from discussions that relate to their own performance appraisal and remuneration. Detail on the committee meeting attendance is included on <a href="">page 58</a>.</p>
                <p>An external rewards specialist is retained to advise the committee on remuneration trends and benchmarking of both executive and non-executive remuneration. The members of the committee have independent access to the adviser and may request professional advice on any remuneration issue.</p>
                <p class="margin-bottom-5px">The primary responsibilities of the committee include:</p>
                <ul class="margin-top-0 margin-bottom-40px">

                <h4 class="sky-blue">Non-executive directors' fees</h4>
                <p>The fee structure for non-executive directors was benchmarked externally against a retail comparator group of The Foschini Group, Mr Price Group, Pick n Pay Stores, Shoprite Holdings, The Spar Group, Truworths International, Massmart Holdings, Woolworths Holdings and Dis-Chem&nbsp;Pharmacies&nbsp;Limited.</p>
                <p>The proposed increases to the fee structure for 2019 take into account these benchmarking results. Higher increases are proposed for the remuneration and nominations committee and social and ethics committee chairs, and members of the remuneration committee, which were below the group’s policy range of 80% of the median of the benchmarked comparator group. The total fees proposed for non-executive directors for the 2019 calendar year represent an increase of 12.5% over the previous year.</p>
                <p>The fees for the 2019 calendar year are subject to approval by shareholders at the AGM in January 2019.</p>

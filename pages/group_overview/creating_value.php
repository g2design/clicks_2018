                <p>In applying its business model the group uses various capital resources to optimise value creation for stakeholders. These stakeholders also contribute to value creation by providing resources: customers (provide revenue by buying products), shareholders (provide capital), employees (provide talents and skills) and suppliers (provide products and services).</p>
                <h2 class="sky-blue">Capitals of value creation</h2>
                <p>The Integrated Reporting Framework of the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC) recommends reporting to shareholders on the six main capital resources that are applied in the creation of value. The group’s performance and activities relative to these six capitals are covered throughout the report. Management has chosen to adapt the IIRC capitals and apply terminology which is more commonly used in managing the business.</p>
